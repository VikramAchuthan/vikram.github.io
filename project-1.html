         <h2>Portfolio Analysis Project</h2>
         <h5 id ="project-1-date">August 2022</h5>
         <p id = "project-1-info">All investors analyze the performance of their investments over time to understand how their investments are performing. Portfolio analysis is an important function that every serious investor does in order to track their performance, help make decisions to allocate resources or understand their tax implications. A portfolio may consist of many financial instruments like stocks, options, real estate, bonds, cds, cash and other combinations of these.

         It is true that many investment trading platforms and brokerages provide these tools and a small investor who has an account with a single broker does not have to rely on a third party to analyze their portfolio. However, any investor who has been investing over a period of time would have opened several accounts. In this case, the investor has to consolidate the records of their financial transactions in one place and rely on a third party tool to perform such an analysis. In my opinion there is no such tool that helps with this challenge that is cheap, user friendly and rich with sophisticated analysis. There is a great need for such a tool that is available to the small retail investor community.
